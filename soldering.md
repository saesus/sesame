# Assembly

## Soldering
### Zener diodes (3.6 V zener diode (DO-35 BZX55C3V6)) (D1,2)
Solder D1-D2.   
Diode is a `polarized` component and therefore take care of direction.   
A Black line on diode is cathode. (square pad on pcb)

### Resistors (R1,2,3,4,5,6)
Solder resistors.

1	1.5 k立 resistor
2	68 立 resistor
1	10 k立 resistor
2	5.1 k立 resistor

### Diodes 1N4148 (universal switching diode (DO-35 1N4148)) (D3-68)
Diode is a `polarized` component and therefore take care of direction.
A Black line on diode is cathode. (square pad on pcb)


### Crystal (XTAL1)
1	16 MHz quarz crystal


### Capacitors (C2,3, C4,5)
There are 2 different capacitors

| Ref  | Value | Lead pitch |
|------|-------|------------|
| C2,3 | 100nf | 2.5mm      |
| C4,5 | 22pF  | 5mm        |

### USB Type-C connector (USB4085-GF-A) (USB1)
Be careful of soldering the small pins. 

### IC socket
Solder IC socket.
IC socket is a `polarized` component, take care of direction.
Check the notch on silk and IC Socket. 
Notch on both should be facing to the right, when the board is right side up.

### Electrolytic capacitor (4.7 uF electrolytic capacitor) and Resettable fuse (500 mA polyfuse) (F1)
Electrolytic capacitor is a `polarized` component, take care of direction.
A short leg is cathode. (square pad on pcb)


### Buttons (6mm momentary push buttons) (Boot1,Reset1)


### ATmega32A
Insert ATmega32A into IC Socket.

ATmega32A is a `polarized` component, take care of direction.
